 * Two things are closed here rather than by a rule somebody has to run. Only the entries a package
 * exports are written, so `@scribe/realtime/src/anything.ts` resolves nowhere and the private half
 * of a package stays private. And every grant sits in the scope of the directory that declared it,
 * so a package pulled in behind another is on disk, is mounted, and is unreachable from code that
 * did not ask for it. Both failures read as Deno's own "not a dependency and not in import map".
 *
 * Addresses are resolved against the map's own location, scoped or not, so a scope key and the
 * paths under it are both written from where the map is written.
