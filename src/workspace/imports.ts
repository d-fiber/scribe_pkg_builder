 * This reads the text of the sources rather than a parsed module graph, the same way the ops
 * fragments are read line by line and for a comparable reason: the map that makes a specifier
 * resolve is written out of this answer, so nothing can be resolved while it is being found. The
 * cost is that a specifier built at runtime is invisible here, which no package does.
 *
 * A specifier carrying a scheme, `npm:` or `jsr:` or `https:`, is left out: it says on its own what
 * answers it, so nothing has to be settled for it. What is left is the bare names, which resolve
 * only through a map, and that map is written once for the whole workspace.
